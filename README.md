# 1F Discord Bot

A simple script for listing https://1fichier.com files from a shared folder and sending them encoded with base64 to a discord bot with a self-decoding hyperlink




How it works
-

1> edit script to tell it what shared folder to look at

2> script will list and edit each file by formatting the file name and url correctly

3> it will the encode the url with base64, this is for DCMA purposes so no one knows what it is

4> it will then post it to a discord webhook with an active hyperlink

Once the hyperlink is clicked

1> take you back to the script and decode the url 

2> provide you with a button with will download the file with a DIRECT LINK














F.A.Q
--

Q. why is the decoder page just one button
-
A. because it is an empty template, design your own webpage around it

Q. why is there so many webhooks
-
A. because this was designed for a discord server with multiple bots and channels, if you want it for just one then edit as it says in the script
